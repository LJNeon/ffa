banned: |-
  {0}'s request to ban you for breaking the following rule has passed: ```
  {1}
  ```They provided the following evidence: ```
  {2}
  ```Use `;log {3}` for more information.

  **If this ban was unjustified or invalid, there are several steps you must take to vindicate yourself:**

  **1.** Send a friend request to every single senator: {4}

  **2.** If none accept your friend request, join all of the most popular servers. You will most likely have mutual servers with some of the senators allowing you to message some of them.

  **3.** DM every senator you can explaining how the ban was unjustified. You must tell them in crucial detail everything regarding the situation, and you must ferociously insist they start an `;unban` case, they sign it, and they lobby on your behalf.

banWarning: |-
  **{0}'s** request to ban you has reached the required amount of signatures. Use `;log {1}` for more information.

  **If this ban is unjustified or invalid, there are several steps you must take to prevent it from happening:**

  **1.** DM every single Supreme Court member: {2}.

  **2.** Explain in crucial detail to every single one of them why you are innocent of the accused crimes. If you are unable to DM them, you must lobby others to do so on your behalf.

  **3.** Ensure you obtain at least one single vote `;against` the ban request. You must do whatever it takes to obtain this vote. The Supreme Court requires a 100% majority for any action to take effect, meaning if only one member supports you, the ban **will not go through**.

between: the {0} must be between {1} and {2}.

  Use `;log {1}` for more information on the case. Carefully review the evidence using `;message <id>`. If a jury deems your ruling unjust, you will suffer severe consequences.

helpMsg: |-
  FFA's goal is to provide a fully decentralized discord server by allowing the community to control every aspect of the server. The entire system is based around reputation. The most reputable users are the Senators. If you believe a certain user is suitable to moderate, you may enter the following: `{0}rep username#1234`. The opposite can be done with `{0}unrep`.

  It is essential that reputation remains in the right hands, as everything revolves around it. It is your duty as a member of this community to ensure that if a user was unjustly punished, the culprit must pay the consequences while vindicating the victim. You may view anyone's reputation by using `{0}getrep`.

  If you wish to view the various command categories, you may use `{0}modules`. To view all the commands of a module, you may use `{0}module general`. You may also view all commands by using `{0}commands`. If you wish to view the progress of this bot, or simply support the creators, you may join the official FFA server here: {1}.

higherRep: you may not use this command on users with a higher reputation than yourself.

  **If this mute was unjustified or invalid, there are several steps you must take to vindicate yourself:**

  **2.** You must use `{5}replb 30` to DM these Senators with undeniable proof of your innocence. You must explain in detail why **{0}'s** mute was invalid, and why it should be reverted.

  **3.** You must ensure **{0}** get's muted for unlawful punishment. You may do this by lobbying other Senators, or by gaining enough reputation to do it yourself. If there is no unlawful punishment rule, create a poll which adds it, and lobby other users to vote in favor of said poll.
